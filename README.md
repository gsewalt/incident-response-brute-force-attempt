## Introduction  
This project demonstrates the **incident response lifecycle** for a suspected brute force attack. Using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Endpoint, I walk through detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities â€” mirroring real SOC workflows.  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Detection  
To detect brute force attempts, I created a custom rule in **Microsoft Sentinel**. The rule identifies when the same remote IP address has failed to log in to the same local host **10 times or more within a 5-hour window**.  

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where isnotempty(RemoteIP)
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(5h)
| summarize BruteForceAttempts = count() by RemoteIP, DeviceName
| where BruteForceAttempts >= 10
```

Once deployed, the rule triggered an incident in Sentinel. I assigned the case to myself and marked it **Active**.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis  
I investigated the triggered incident in Sentinel.  

- **Scope of activity:**  
  - 8 separate assets targeted  
  - 28 source IP addresses involved  
  - 9 unique public IPs confirmed as sources

To validate whether any of these brute force attempts were successful, I ran the following query:  

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where ActionType != "LogonFailed"
| where RemoteIP in ("07.136","196.251.88.103","134.199.197.70","183.4.22.154",
"85.122.94.52","59.18.141.14","210.222.67.223","222.114.67.46","222.252.97.171")
```

**Result:** No successful logons were observed.

## ðŸ›¡ Containment, Eradication, Recovery  
Although the brute force attempts were unsuccessful, I carried out containment and recovery actions to ensure no further exposure:  

- Isolated the affected assets and scanned with **Microsoft Defender Endpoint**.  
- Hardened the **Network Security Group (NSG)** to block inbound RDP (TCP/3389) from the public internet.

At this point, no compromise was detected and systems were confirmed clean.  

---

## ðŸ“‘ Post-Incident Activities  
All investigation details were documented in Sentinelâ€™s activity log. To strengthen long-term defenses, I proposed a security policy requiring all company assets to follow a similar NSG rule.

## âœ… Closure  
- Reviewed incident notes and finalized the investigation report.
- Closed the case in Sentinel as a **Benign Positive**.  
- Lessons learned were rolled into updated access control policy.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  
- **T1110 â€“ Brute Force**: Multiple failed authentication attempts.  
- **T1078 â€“ Valid Accounts (Prevented)**: Potential objective was credential compromise.  
- **T1133 â€“ External Remote Services**: Targeting of RDP services.  
- **T1046 â€“ Network Service Scanning (Implied)**: Reconnaissance prior to brute force attempts.
